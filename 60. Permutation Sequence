The algorithm that came into my mind immediately is use algorithm
which we used in Next Permutation, so we can solve the problem with 
O(nk) time complexity and O(1)space.
The easiest way to do it is do a while loop, and then compare k with n 
factorial. The complexity of this algorithm should be O(n), space complexity
O(n).
