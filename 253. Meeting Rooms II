To get the minimum number of rooms we need at the same time,
we should know how many meetings are procedeed at the same time.

When a meeting starts, the required rooms will plus one,
when a meeting ends, the required rooms should minus one.

Based on that, we can build a new array to store the meeting intervals.
The elements in the array has two features, the first one is time,
the second one is used to decide record if if starts or ends. 

Sort the array（when time of two tasks are same, the end-task will be put in the font.）

Now we need to do is to iterate the array, and sum the second elements of each tuple in the array.

The peak of the sum is the required number of rooms we need.
