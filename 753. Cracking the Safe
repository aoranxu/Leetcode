It's a NP-hard problem.
We can build a graph and use dfs to solve this problem.
For n digits, each digit can have k choices, so the total 
number of possibilities should be k^n.
Build a graph with k^n points, each point has k edges.
The space complexity should be O(k^n), the time complexity 
should be O(k^(k^n)).
