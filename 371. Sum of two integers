    The negative number in python will be represented in one's complement, 
and the value of integer in python is not restricted by bits. However, 
the input should ne a 32-bits signed integer, so we need a mask to 
restricted the number to 32 bits. At the end, if the highest bit is 1, 
it will not output a negative integer, so we shoud "xor" to get its 
positive number, then flip it to get the final result
