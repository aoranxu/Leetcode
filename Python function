1.sort(key=lambda x: x.start):
Optional. A function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key 
from each list element. The default value is None (compare the elements directly).
In Python, lambda is a keyword used to define anonymous functions(functions with no name)
and that's why they are known as lambda functions.

2.cmp:
cmp specifies a custom comparison function of two arguments (iterable elements) 
which should return a negative, zero or positive number depending on whether 
the first argument is considered smaller than, equal to, or larger than 
the second argument: cmp=lambda x,y: cmp(x.lower(), y.lower()). The default value is None.

3. defaultdict:
A defaultdict works exactly like a normal dict, but it is initialized with a function (“default factory”) 
that takes no arguments and provides the default value for a nonexistent key.
This works well as long as it is appropriate for all keys to have the same default
