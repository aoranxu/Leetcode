We should be careful that there are two different numbers which appear only once,
the we use a variable to do xor with all numbers in the array, the result should 
be the XOR of the two target number. And we find a bit whose value is one, and based on
this bit, we can divide the original array into two groups. Then xor the two groups respectively
then we can get the two target numbers.

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):

        ans = 0
        for num in nums:
            ans ^= num
        mask = 1
        while mask & ans == 0:
            mask <<= 1

        for num in nums:
            if num & mask:
                a ^= num
            else:
