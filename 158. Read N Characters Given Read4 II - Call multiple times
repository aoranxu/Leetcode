The main difference between this problem and "157. Read N Characters Given Read4" 
is that read function can be called multi[le times, so when we should memorize the 
position in the file which we read before, so we use a queue to implement this function.

from Queue import Queue
class Solution(object):
        
    def read(self, buf, n):
        """
        :type buf: Destination buffer (List[str])
        :type n: Maximum number of characters to read (int)
        :rtype: The number of characters read (int)
        """
        idx = 0
        while True:
            buf4 = [""] * 4
            r = read4(buf4)
            if r == 0:
                return idx
            curr = min(n - idx, r)
            for i in xrange(curr):
                buf[idx] = buf4[i]
                idx += 1
            if curr == 0:
                return idx
