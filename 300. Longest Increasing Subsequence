1. Dp, time:O(n^2), space:O(n)
2. Binary search:
we use a array tails to record the tail element
of increasing sequence with different size, eg,
rails[1] represent the last element of the size 2
increasing sequence. When we find a position where
tails[i - 1] < x < tails[i], we update tails[i].
The length of the tails is what we need.
The time: O(nlogn), space:O(n) in the worst case.
