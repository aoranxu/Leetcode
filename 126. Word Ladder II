1. BFS, layer by layer
2. Bi-directional BFS
3. DFS, we use bfs firstly to calculate the distance between
each word in the dict and the end word, then use dfs to search
the path. Suppose current distance to the end is , we only need to seach 
word whose distance is d - 1.

BFS

Time Complexity: O(n*26^l) -> O(n*26^l/2), l = len(word), n=|wordList|

Space Complexity: O(n)

Space: O(N)
