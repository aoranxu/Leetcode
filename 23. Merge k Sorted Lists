1. Divide and Conquer. Mergesort-like.
n is the average length of a linked List.
 O(nk log k) runtime, O(1) space


2.Min Heap
n - amount of nodes in all lists
k - amount of lists

We'll perform both heap push and heap pop operations once for each node, each of these operations take log(k) time, thus the time complexity is O(2 * n * log(k)) = O(nlog(k))

Space complexity:
At any time we store maximum k nodes in the heap, then O(k)
